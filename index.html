  <div class="callout-copy">
    <p>
      LacyBPottery was born out of the Basinger family's love for their patriarch's pottery, Bill Basinger.
      While attending Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, Bill enrolled in several art and ceramic classes.
      Upon acquiring his masters degree in the early 1960's,
      Bill remained in Muncie for several years teaching others about the craft and trade of ceramics.
      Later on his life, he settled in Little Rock, Arkansas, and opened up a pottery workshop in his home.
      At the ripe old age of 88, he continues his passion to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill has passed on his knowledge to his son, David; his daughter-in-law, Lacy;
      and his grandchildren, Brennan, Meredith, Mary Frances, and Jessi.
      Continuing the family tradition started by Bill,
      David and Lacy opened a studio of their own in the fall of 2016 in Grenada, Mississippi.
    </p>
    <p>
      David enjoys throwing on the wheel, and Lacy prefers the art of hand-building.
      Their children, Brennan, Meredith, Mary Frances and Jessi all contribute to the work as well.
      All of LacyBPottery’s stoneware is oven, microwave and dishwasher safe.
      Every piece of Lacy’s hand-built designs is one of a kind, which makes each of them a wonderful, unique gift.

  <h2>How It's Made</h2>
  <p>
    The intricate process taken to create any piece of pottery encompasses a number of sequential steps.
    We've decided to produce a series of videos with the intent of demonstrating the chronologically ordered
    events that each piece of clay undergoes during the pottery creation process.
    Check in regularly for upcoming releases of new episodes detailing exactly how
    each piece of clay is uniquely designed within our studio at LacyBPottery.
