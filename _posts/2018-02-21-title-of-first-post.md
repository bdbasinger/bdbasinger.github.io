I’ll be drawing names Wednesday, February 28. So, if you haven’t already, (and there are many of you) be sure to share a pic of your purchase on YOUR Facebook page and or Instagram account. Make it public, and let me know you did it if you can’t tag me. I want to make sure you are entered in the drawing. Winner receives a $50 gift certificate! Also, come VOTE on your favorite candle scent for a chance to WIN a candle!
