Hi everyone! I have decided to create a Lacybpottery group because I think it will make our posts accessible to a larger audience.

For some reason most people don't see the majority of posts that I put on the Lacybpottery page or my personal page. In honor of our new group, I will be doing another GIVEAWAY!! This time instead of having a set prize, I will give away a $50 gift certificate for your choice of Lacybpottery to be used at La Bella Fonte Galleria in Grenada! All you have to do to be entered into the drawing is add (new)3 people to the group! (one chance for every 3 people added) The contest will remain open until we reach 1000 members. So, please add away!
